# Opvia Take-home Product Challenge

Congratulations on being selected for the penultimate stage of our interview process!

We really appreciate the time you have invested so far and only invited you to this challenge because we think there's a very good chance we'd be a great fit.

This is our only opportunity to see how you deliver on a product problem, so we value it very highly.

## How to complete this stage of the interview process

1. Please clone this repo and use it as your starting point
2. Complete the 'Opvia product problem' below
3. When you are done, create a private repo and push your code to it
4. Invite _hfmw_ & _Albertopvia_ to view the repo

## Opvia product problem

Scientists are automatically uploading their data from bioreactors into Opvia. To help you, some example data is already loaded into the table.

In the example data, each row shows the density of the cells and the total volume in the bioreactor at a given point in time.

The scientists want to calculate the cell count at any point in time, as well as being able to see the maximum cell count.

Instead of building in these specific features, we have identified two higher level features to build which would solve their problem, and would be useful to all of our customers:

1. `Calculation columns`, these are columns in the table that are populated based on a user defined formula e.g. A cell count column that is created by the formula: `Cell Density * Volume` 
2.  A `Column Aggregations` feature which allows a user to perform operations on a selected data column, such as showing the `Maximum Density`, `Minimum Cell Count`, etc...

You have a call scheduled with the scientist. Build a working MVP of these higher level features that you could show the user to gather their feedback. Please use <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprintjs</a>.

Put any notes and your instructions in the README as well as what you would do next to improve this. Please also answer how you would make it possible to do `Rate of change calculations` e.g. `Rate of Cell Count Growth`

#### FAQS

- Can I change the structure/content of the raw data? - yes feel free to, but don't feel obligated to (this is a product not an engineering challenge)
- Unsure whether to submit? Would you happily get on a call with a scientist and show them this?
- Ran out of time? Make this clear in the readme, and write out what you would do next.
- I have a question? Please ask!! Email `will@opvia.io` and cc `alberto@opvia.io`.
- How should I communicate? Please over communicate. We want to learn what it's like to work with you :)
- What are you looking for? Pretend this is a real challenge you were given. We want to see something that would be useful to show to a scientist to gather feedback. We don't care about the code â€“ this is a product challenge to test your ability to start with a problem, not a design.
