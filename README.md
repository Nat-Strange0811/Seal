# **The Seal Challenge**

**A Note on Time & Privacy**: This is a 2-3 hour challenge. If you find yourself spending more than 4 hours, you’re overthinking it. We respect your privacy, and your work will remain confidential.

**The Mission:** Life-changing products in days, not decades. The bottleneck isn’t a lack of ideas; it’s the gauntlet of proving and producing them. Shackled to paper, the GxP validation and manufacturing process is so slow that it limited the world to just 10 new biologics last year. We build the AI-first platform these teams deserve, one that uses AI to conquer the burden of paper validation and unify their work. This is the foundation that will finally allow life-saving products to be proven and scaled at the speed of computation, not bureaucracy.

**How We Work:** This challenge is a direct simulation of our process. Engineers at Seal own problems, not tickets. You will speak directly with the scientists using our tools, understand their core needs, and ship a solution to our core platform that has an immediate impact.

**The Test:** Your task is to solve a real user problem with an elegant product.

We have a simple data table. A scientist needs to create a new column by performing a calculation on existing columns (e.g., `Column A * Column B`).

**Your goal is to build this one interaction perfectly.**

The bar for success is a working prototype that is so intuitive and well-crafted that it would impress a customer.

## **Submission**

1.  To get started, **clone our boilerplate repo** (do not fork it) and push it to a **new private repository** on your own GitHub account.
2.  **Deploy your prototype** to a public URL (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). The deployment should be anonymous (no names in the URL or on the page) to ensure merit-based review.
3.  When finished, **submit the link to your live prototype** via this form: **[https://forms.gle/E9LASH1Nyhoa3pu48](https://forms.gle/E9LASH1Nyhoa3pu48)** including the answers to the below questions in 'additional comments'

## **Questions**

1.  **Scalability:** Your UI works for 100 rows. In one sentence, what is the most important change you would make for it to work with 1,000,000 rows, and why?
2.  **Extensibility:** How would you adapt your design for a `Rate of Change` calculation (`(value_t2 - value_t1) / (time_t2 - time_t1)`)?

## **Evaluation**

We will look at your submission and ask one question: **Did you build something great?**

*P.S. getting set up is low-signal – if we can make it quicker to get started with this challenge please tell us. Likewise if you don't think this is the best test of your skills.*
