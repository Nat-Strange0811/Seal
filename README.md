# Opvia Take-home Product Challenge 

Congratulations on being selected for the next stage of our interview process! 

We really appreciate the time you have invested in the process so far and only invited you to this next challenge because we think there’s a very good chance you’d be a great fit at Opvia. This is the penultimate step in the interview process! For context at this stage the probability of a candidate receiving an offer is (~25%).

At Opvia we do believe it’s important that all engineers have an appreciation for product and an ability to empathize with the end user. It may be that you are not a ‘product’ person. That’s OK.

## How to complete this stage of the interview process

1. Please clone this repo and use it as your starting point. This is a simple create-react-app featuring the blueprintjs table component https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#table
2. Take your time to complete the 'Opvia product problem' below. It's up to you how you go about this!
3. Invite *hfmw* to your own repo with your solution when you're done

## Opvia product problem

Here's the situation: scientists are using Opvia to store all their data in a standardised structure in one place. However, it's not very useful for analysis because scientists can't yet apply formulas to the data. You've told a customer that you're building this feature and you're going to demo it to them...

Make it possible for users to add ‘calculation columns`:
- The user should be able to write a formula where they can specify columns to calculate against
- This is the functionality required you've identified with the user:
  - Column based basic maths (addition, multiplication etc.) (e.g. multiplying cell density column and volume column)
  - Row based formula (e.g. show the rate of change of cell counts)

## What we're looking for

Make something that would make the scientist happy!

Unsure whether to submit? Would you happily sit down with a scientist and show them what you've built? Would what you've showed them make them more excited about using Opvia?

## FAQS
- Can I use typescript? - of course, I've just provided a starting point to save time
- Can I change the structure/content of the raw data? - of course if you would like to

## Any questions

If you have any questions, or anything is unclear please email Will Moss at will.moss@opvia.bio
