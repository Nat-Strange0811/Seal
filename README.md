# Seal Product Challenge

This challenge is a simulation of a core task at Seal: turning customer problems into a well-designed product. Your approach to this problem will be the most important factor in our evaluation.

We are not testing your coding ability. We are looking to understand how you think and the quality of the experience you create.

## The Task

**1. Understand the Context:**
Scientists use Seal to collect raw data from their lab experiments. For example, a bioreactor might log cell density and volume over time. The data is collected accurately, but Seal currently lacks tools for even basic analysis.

**2. Define the Problem:**
A scientist needs to perform a simple calculation (`Cell Density * Volume`) and find the maximum value of that result.

**3. Build a Prototype:**
To solve this class of problem for all our users, prototype two features:
* **`Calculation Columns`**: A way for users to create new columns using formulas.
* **`Column Aggregations`**: A way to perform simple operations like `MAX` on a column.

The functional scope is intentionally small. This isn't a test of feature quantity. We're focused entirely on the quality of your execution and the thinking behind it.

**4. Deliver the Prototype:**
The deliverable is a prototype judged on the quality of the user experience. It must be so intuitive that a scientist can accomplish their goal with zero instruction, and the interaction should feel so simple and well-crafted that they are left impressed.
* Use [Blueprintjs](https://blueprintjs.com/).
* Clone this repo into a private one and invite `_hfmw_`.
* Add the link to this [form](https://forms.gle/E9LASH1Nyhoa3pu48).
* In the README, explain how to run the prototype and outline your thinking on what to build next, including how you would approach more complex `Rate of Change` calculations.

## How We Evaluate This Challenge

If anything is unclear as you work, please ask. We want too much communication (will@seal.run).

A successful demonstrates a deep consideration for the user's experience and leaves the impression of a simple, elegant solution. It's the kind of work you would be proud to have a customer scrutinize.

We hold this bar because we are a small team that gives individuals full ownership of their work, from the initial idea to the final user experience. This level of autonomy requires a high degree of product sense and an obsessive care for detail. Your work on this challenge is the clearest signal we have of how you think, solve problems, and what you consider a high-quality outcome.
