# **The Seal Challenge**

**A Note on Time & Privacy:** This is a **2-4 hour challenge**. We respect your time and your privacy. Your work on this challenge will remain confidential.

**The Mission:** Our goal is to accelerate the arrival of life-changing technologies, from personalized medicines to sustainable solutions. The GxP bottleneck means these breakthroughs take decades; we exist to make it take days. Our first step is to create a unified system of record for scientists, moving them from paper and spreadsheets. This is the critical foundation that will unlock our ultimate goal: enabling them to fully simulate their processes.

**How We Work:** This challenge simulates our process. Engineers at Seal own problems, not tickets. You will speak directly with the scientists using our tools, understand their core needs, and ship a solution to our core platform that has an immediate impact.

**The Test:** Your task is to solve a real user problem with an elegant product.

We have a simple data table. A scientist needs to create a new column by performing a calculation on existing columns (e.g., `Column A * Column B`).

**Your goal is to build this one interaction perfectly.**

The bar for success is a working prototype that is so intuitive and well-crafted that it would impress a customer.

## **Submission**

1.  To get started, **clone our boilerplate repo** (do not fork it) and push it to a **new private repository** on your own GitHub account.
2.  **Deploy your prototype** to a public URL (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). The deployment itself should be anonymous.
3.  **Answer the two questions below** in the README of your private repository.
4.  When finished, **submit only the link to your live prototype** via this form: **[https://forms.gle/E9LASH1Nyhoa3pu48](https://forms.gle/E9LASH1Nyhoa3pu48)**

## **Questions**

1.  **Scalability:** Your UI works for 100 rows. In one sentence, what is the most important change you would make for it to work with 1,000,000 rows, and why?
2.  **Extensibility:** How would you adapt your design for a `Rate of Change` calculation (`(value_t2 - value_t1) / (time_t2 - time_t1)`)? In one or two sentences, what is the primary challenge this introduces?

## **Evaluation**

We will look at your submission and ask one question: **Did you build something great?**

*P.S. getting set up is low-signal â€“ if we can make it quicker to get started with this challenge please tell us. likewise if you don't think this is the best test of your skills*
