# Opvia Take-home Product Challenge 

Congratulations on being selected for the next stage of our interview process! 

We really appreciate the time you have invested in the process so far and only invited you to this next challenge because we think there’s a very good chance you’d be a great fit at Opvia. This is the penultimate step in the interview process! For context at this stage the probability of a candidate receiving an offer is (~25%). 

This is our only opportunity to see what you can build so we weight it very highly. Please do show us what you can do!

## How to complete this stage of the interview process

1. Please clone this repo and use it as your starting point. This is a simple create-react-app featuring the blueprintjs table component https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#table
2. Take your time to complete the 'Opvia product problem' below. It's up to you how you go about this!
3. Invite *hfmw* to your own repo with your solution when you're done

## Opvia product problem

Here's the situation: scientists are using Opvia to store all their data in a standardised structure in one place. However, it's not very useful for analysis because scientists can't yet apply formulas to the data. You've told a customer that you're building this feature and you're going to demo it to them...

Make it possible for users to add ‘calculation columns`:
- The user should be able to write a formula where they can specify columns to calculate against
- This is the functionality required you've identified with the user:
  - Column based basic maths (addition, multiplication etc.) (e.g. multiplying cell density column and volume column -> cell count)
  - Row based formula (e.g. show the rate of change of the calculated cell count)

### What we're looking for

Make something that would make the scientist happy!

Unsure whether to submit? Would you happily sit down with a scientist and show them what you've built? Would what you've showed them make them more excited about using Opvia?

#### FAQS
- Can I use typescript? - yes, use whatever setup you'd like
- Can I change the structure/content of the raw data? - yes feel free to, but don't feel obligated to (this is a product not and engineering challenge)

#### Any questions

If you have any questions, or anything is unclear please email Will Moss at will.moss@opvia.bio
